# File IO - 4: Extracting all data from an unstructured data file

## Vocabulary

**unstructured data**: data that does not have a predefined format. This can include text files with no delimiters, images, audio, video, etc. This lesson focuses on text files that contain prose or other human-readable text not designed for reading by a computer.

**prose**: written or spoken language in its ordinary form, without metrical structure.

## Example : counting things in a text file

Human-generated text in a specific language has a lot of hidden structure, like the frequencies of words or letters or digits. We can extract this information from a text file and use it to analyse the text. Sometimes this could just be looking words up in the text, but other times it might be to check the authenticity of the text or other forensic analysis.

> ...the rest of this one is left as an exercice for the reader. ðŸ˜‚ The content of this lesson is not yet written, but is more about algorithms than file I/O anyway.
