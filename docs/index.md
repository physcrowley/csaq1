# File Input/Output Unit Plan

ICS3U

> Author : David Crowley, EAO

## Overview

This is the final superpower of this course. Conditional execution gave us intelligence. Looping gave us power. This gives us access to knowledge.

If you can understand how to read and write data from structured and unstructured text files then use the data to do interesting things in your program, you will have everything you need to interact with all kinds of data sources: databases, social media APIs, scientific instrumentation log files, etc. The jump from here to other (binary) data sources - like images, audio and video - is often just a question of learning the appropriate library or module while the basic principles remain the same.

### Learning outcomes

- I can load data from a file into program memory using commands appropriate to how the data is organised within the file.
- I can write output to a file instead of to the console.
- I can analyse the data or incorporate it into the rest of the program using appropriate algorithms.

## Success criteria

- I can integrate file reading and/or writing into my own programs effectively to manage persistent or external data sources.

## Lessons

1. [Managing resource access in Python using `with open()`](./1_with-open.md)
2. [Extracting data from a simple file](./2_simple-data.md)
3. [Extracting data line-by-line from a structured data file](./3_structured-data.md)
4. [Extracting all data from an unstructured data file](./4_unstructured-data.md)
5. [Writing output to a file](./5_file-output.md)

## Practical assessment

This unit is all about using a more powerful tool to manage data: files! It is a practical unit that applies nearly all of the concepts we have picked up throughout the course.

See the [project page](./assessment.md) for details.
