## File Input/Output Unit Project


## Context

In this project, you will be applying the basics of file writing and reading with Python.

## Task

1. Use Python to generate some structured data that you will write to a file named `data.txt` in a subfolder of your project folder called `files`
   1. The structure should be simple: two or more fields of data that are separated by a delimiter (like a comma or a tab). 
   2. The data should be generated by your program, not entered by the user. You can use mathematical operations and/or some form of randomness to generate the values.
   3. One field should be text, the others can be numerical.
   4. Include a header row that describes the fields and uses the same delimiter as the data.
   5. There should be at least 100 records (lines) in the data set.
2. In the same program, read the data back from the file and perform some analysis on it. For example, calculate the average of the numerical fields, or their sum, or their most common value (their mode).
3. Write the results of your analysis to all of the following destinations:
   1. a string variable
   2. a file (named `results.txt`)
   3. the console

## Deliverables

1. A Python program that performs the tasks described above.
   - The header comment of this file should include all the normal information, but also a description of who the data is structured in your `data.txt` file.
2. The two text files (`data.txt` and `results.txt`) that your program creates.

## Assessment

Your program will be assessed on the following criteria:

-[ ] CO: All deliverables are submitted in the requested format.

-[ ] CO: The code is well-structured and easy to read (variable names are descriptive, comments are used where necessary).

-[ ] AP: The program conforms to all of the task requirements.

-[ ] AP: The program doesn't crash when run.


## Additional resources

The following video by Corey Schafer does a good job of recapping the basics of file input/output in Python and goes into some topics that were not covered in this unit (like reading and writing binary files like images).
