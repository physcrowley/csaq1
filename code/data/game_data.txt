You are in a dim basement, lit only by the pale glow of the computer screen.
It has been days since you have seen the sun.

Computer

You see a screen with a blinking cursor. It is waiting for your command.
In fact, it is waiting for you to type `exit`.

Furnace room

What a mess! You can't even see the furnace for all the junk in here.
Oh wait! Is that my old skateboard?
